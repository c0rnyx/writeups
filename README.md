# Penetration Testing & CTF Writeups

This repository contains my penetration testing and CTF writeups from platforms such as HackTheBox, TryHackMe, PortSwigger Web Academy, and various CTF challenges.

Each writeup focuses on:

- **Recon & Enumeration** – detailed scanning, discovery, and analysis  
- **Vulnerability Identification** – understanding attack surfaces and root causes  
- **Exploitation** – step-by-step exploitation with commands and reasoning  
- **Privilege Escalation** – complete escalation methodology on Linux/Windows  
- **Post-Exploitation & Mitigation** – what I learned and how to fix the issue  
- **Clear Documentation** – screenshots, structured notes, and reproducible steps  

These writeups demonstrate my methodology, communication skills, and practical offensive security knowledge. Flags and sensitive information are omitted according to platform rules.
