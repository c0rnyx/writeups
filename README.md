# writeups
This repository contains writeups from my CTFs and labs. Each writeup documents my methodology, tools that were used, exploitation steps, chosen path to privilege escalation, and potential remediation recommendations. The focus of the writeups has been set on clear communication, simulating real-world attacker workflows.
